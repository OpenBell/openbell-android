Open source doorbell project, from button to app
================================================

This is an open source project created to assist Bedford College students with their development. Although the API and app are functional, all the API keys and tokens are deliberately exposed to assist with the understanding and learning of how the system operates. You are strongly warned that this could lead to mischief-making including random doorbell notifications, finding your doorbell registrations deleted by somebody else, being subscribed to unknown doorbells, and more. You are encouraged to learn but discouraged from relying on the project as it stands. As this is an open source project you are free to host the files on your own server and generate your own API keys and tokens to secure your own doorbell notification system.

For source code please check out the project [website](https://openbell.org/).
